# Internal Runbook (Draft)

This document captures monorepo-specific guidance for the legacy `tests/aware_tests` workflow while the package extraction is in progress.

## Pending Content
- Environment setup instructions (uv workspace, Flutter tooling).
- Mapping between historical suite names and the upcoming manifest split.
- Migration steps for CI pipelines still invoking `uv run aware-tests ...` within the repository.

_Update this runbook as the new package reaches parity with the internal tooling._
